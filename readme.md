Allows you to create presentations with the WordPress block editor.

## Description

Requires the latest [Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/) release!

Report issues, or collaborate, on [Github](https://github.com/ellatrix/slides/issues).

* Creates a custom post type "Presentation", which will render as a presentation on the front end using [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com).
* Enables the block editor with a "Slide" block, which can be used as a container for each slide in the presentation.
* You can add background colors, gradients, images, even iframes for the whole presentation, but also per slide.
* You can select a font, color, and size.
* If that's not enough, you can always add some custom CSS!
* You can import a custom font by adding `@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=...');` above any other rules in the CSS input field.
* It's possible to include some notes with every slide.
* You can enter a speaker view which will show the current slide, next slide, notes and timers.
* A lot more options coming soon!
